    "**Ans.** `shutil.copy()` method is used copy the contents of a file from one file to another file/folder, it primaraly takes two arguments `src`,`dest`, \"src\" represents the file to be copied where as destination refers to the file to where the src data should be copied, if dest is a folder name the src with exact name will be copied to the dest folder, if its a file then the contents of src will be copied to dest where dest retains it name.\n",

    "`shutil.copytree()` function is used to copy the entire contents of a folder to other folder. it also takes two arguments `src` & `dest`, it copies all the content recursively and stores it in dest. the important catch here is dest must not exist prior to this and it will be created during the copy operation. Permissions and times of directories are copied with `shutil.copystat()` and individual files are copied using `shutil.copy2()` by default which can be modified using copy_function attribute."
